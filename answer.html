  <p>What is HTTP?</p>
  <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is governs how clients get data from, or send data to, a server.</p>
  <p>What is a URL?</p>
  <p>Short for Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is an address for some internet resource.</p>
  <p>What is DNS?</p>
  <p>Short for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.</p>
  <p>What is a query string?</p>
  <p>The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the format <b>?key1=value1&key2=value2...</b></p>
  <p>List two HTTP Verbs and their use cases.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GET - get some data from the server (most pages, search forms)</li>
    <li>POST - send some data to the server (pages that change data on server)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What is an HTTP request?</p>
  <p>An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol (eg a request for HTML from
  news.google.com)</p>
  <p>What is an HTTP response?</p>
  <p>An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol (eg sending back
  HTML/CSS/JS/etc)</p>
  <p>What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</p>
  <p>Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control</li>
    <li>Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What happens when you type a URL in a browser?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS</li>
    <li>Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other
    things)</li>
    <li>The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)</li>
    <li>The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)</li>
    <li>The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each</li>
  </ol>
